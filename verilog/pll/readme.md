# PLL example

## Overview
`plltest` is a simple demonstration of setting up a PLL using `ecppll`, so that it generates a 100 MHz clock from system's 48 MHz clock. The frequency of the 48 MHz and 100 MHz signals is divided by the same factor (2 ^ 27) and used to drive, respectively, the red and green LEDs. The blue LED lights up when the PLL is locked.

You will see the blue LED constanly on, and the blue and green ones switching onn and off out of phase with one another.

## Files

- `plltest.v` — The `top` (e.g. 'main') module, that describes the counter, and the hooking of the counter's bits to the RGB LED.
- `pll.v` — This will be generated by the Makefile, which invokes `ecppll -i 48 -o 100 -f pll.v`
- `Makefile` — The make build script that will produce the bitstream from the HDL. It makes uses of the open source tools `yosys`, `nextpnr`, `ecppll`, `ecppack`, and `dfu-util` to go from hardware description to bitstream to running on the FPGA.
